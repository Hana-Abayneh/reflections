1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Ans :- when you initialize a repository with the git init command, you make that repository a git 
		   repository. you need to do that because unless it is a git repository the history will not 
		   be saved. hence no using of version control. so if you need to use git version control on
		   your directory or project you need to first make sure that it is a git repository.


2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Ans :- the staging area is where files that are to be committed are placed. much like when you go
  	       to the grocery store and put items in your cart. think of the items as files and the cart as the
	       staging area. the working directory is your project folder. where all your untracked files 
	       reside. then when you "git add" your files they become tracked and copied to the staging area 
    	       with their changes. the repository is the .git folder where every history is saved. so the staging
	       area is useful because it allows us to pick files that we want to commit. say there are 3 files changed
   	       and we want only the two to be committed. so we can add the two then when we git commit only the two will
	       be committed.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
